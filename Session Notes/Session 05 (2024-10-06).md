>Anna met us in the morning and informed us that her three sons were the ones that were defeated by Thea/Thonk and converted to Vanir by me.  We left [[Kaia's Lodge]] to head north to [[Enso Vast]].  We saw a fire on a mountain top and went to investigate.  While we were "stealthy" approaching we were attacked by bugbears.  After the fight we saw they were worshipping a [[Pahkleos the Vengeful (LE)]].  Dwarves trying to take back the the territory thats was taken by a dragon.  After the fight we find Avariel on the road by herself.  After a short discussion she joins us as we continue our trek to [[Enso Vast]]

> After a long rest we are made aware of a commotion outside.  The lady is having words with the white dragonborn from whitewings army we saw last night.  She makes him snarl and walk away.  The lady is wearing a giant hat.  She introduces herself as Sahkayaana.  She is a "teacher" I don't really have much more cuz I was bored with the convo and didn't pay attn.  She left without anything being said.  Tashi wants to talk to me next week....yippee
