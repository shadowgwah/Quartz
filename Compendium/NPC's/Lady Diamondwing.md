>The Dragon most consider the ruler of Axefall province, known for her keen interest in magic. No Diamondwing has been seen since news of the Whitewing coup and the change of Emperors. It is unknown where their loyalties and interests lie.  She sent [[Nyergen]]'s family to give [[Dakhsun Vede]] a diamond to help him.
