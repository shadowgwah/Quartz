God of Bargains, Pacts, and Promises, known to many as 'the Preeminent Devil' Once known as Galdrien the Virtuous Ibrazzalak was the only Ascended (so far) to be fully corrupted & 'taken over' by the Soulplague - having struck a deal gaining himself further power in return for his assistance spreading the Plague. Not an openly celebrated holiday in most civilized lands save Ygrushia, Ipotri, and Ceberach in Theolland where Devils have not-entirely-secret influences. Although many worldwide do so in secret. However, being the previous Patron of a large portion of the world's Knighthoods, Paladins, and similar organisations many of those carry on by tradition this date for their ceremonies, such as the Order of the Gleaming Stag, the Cavalry force of Maraskien currently off fighting the Thaaki Giants somewhere to the southwest, unaware to the most part that their prayers to ‘Galdrien’ instead reach Ibrazzalak, although Seleyne has been working to intercept & fix this problem.
