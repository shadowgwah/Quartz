Favoured Weapon: Sling

Outfits: Pale indigo Robes without ornamentation, usually with simple necklaces & bracelets of stones such as Citrine, Quartz, Celestite, and Angelite that mark their status. Secondary colours are pale blue, also worn in some places (Opparo), but in Theolland often where White in public as a sign of peaceful intent.   

Creations: ¼ Ascended involved in the creation of the Accreted, or Aasimar. Often deals with many Celestials- many of the non-draconic looking Celestials were the efforts of Kadoul & Amearol together to create a necessary force for peace, Amerol believing that a force fated to non-violence would bring about positive change. The ‘Dream Dwarves’ of Iccarox (Kamchatka) are a product of Buried Ones created by Dumeanin & Kadoul together, have divination abilities to sense danger but lack the trading & creative bent of most other Buried ones lacking Mavriadax’s influence.
