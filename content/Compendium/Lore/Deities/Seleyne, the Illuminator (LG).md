>Known as: The Lady of Light(Zenith), Xylene Lightbringer(Northern Theolland), She-who-illuminates(Caovria), the Eternal Crusader(Favriol)

Domains: LIGHT, ZEAL*,Twilight, War, Order, Life

Allies: Kadoul(Peace & Healing), Xeala(Freedom & Luck), C.Ythemiir(Elven War god), Raevun(Justice & Truth), Farthorn (Nature), Tovakh (Strength), Fuezantra(Travel & Sky) 

Rivals: Esmelda(Love & Family, once friends as mortals), Brantham M.(Trickery), Flaozash (Fire, keeps trying to take her home on the Sun), most all Evil-aligned except Pahkleos (Vengeance & Jealousy) who Seleyne listens to and often can get to calm down, Tygruth (War has a purpose), and Ualcâzd (Ice, Winter) who she has no big reason to fight with. Hates Undead most of all considers them the biggest problem, so Cydrine is primary rival & therefore Aggrash is #2. 

Homeland: Onnasvrio (Northern-central Theolland, north edge of the Nasviera desert. Earthly: Iran) 

Centres of Worship: Onnasvrio, Iyvaria (Greece), Aevyrn & Utherys (Turkey/Egypt), the Lightless Expanse (Hawai’i & Polynesia) 

Holiday: Summer 16th. (Summer Solstice)

Favoured Weapon: Maul 

Outfits: Polished Breastplate armour, white robes with intersecting diagonal stripes of lavender/gold/lavender and a central circle where the lines meet. New lines other than the basic are usually added for ‘great victories’- lavender inside the gold for spiritual, emotional, and defeating undead, gold bands along the outside for others such as defeating demons or orcs. 

(Picture would be 4x Spiritual/Undead victories) 

Creations: ¼ Ascended involved in creating the Accreted (Aasimar) from humans to assist them in fighting off the Demonic hordes in Favriol, granting them control over light. Pallid (Grey) Elves were an agreement Seleyne made with Alviera Ythemiir to try to help the doomed Elves of the 2nd Odyssey navigate the world-storm that surrounds Zenith.

(Survivors landed at Haithus & Quathrinel), while the Shadar-kai were the combined efforts of Seleyne & Caidreth Ythemiir to make Ythemians better able to survive the horrors of their cursed, undead-covered homeland of Al Aliem. Usually however, Seleyne’s too busy fighting wars to create anything new. 

D&D Lore comparison: Tyr (F.Realms/Norse same thing), Dol Arrah (Eberron)

  

In life, Seleyne was said to have never taken no for an answer to anything- according to legends once marching off to battle alone after her allies were afraid to and standing alone for hours before help finally arrived. Her enemies like to say Seleyne has no business being among the Ascended, the magic involved to do so being far beyond her capabilities, but even if that’s true, anyone who managed to join the 2nd strongest spell ever cast (Ritual of Ascension, behind Amearol’s Reality implosion) through sheer force of will alone is not to be taken lightly. As an Ascended, Seleyne (and her followers) are on the forefront of every battle, always searching for the next evil to rout out, next wrong to right, often taking no time to appreciate their victories or any of the things that are good in life. They never retreat despite the odds, and will often smash even the smallest problems with a massive hammer. Seleyne does care about each and every one of her followers, and if she got her chance she’d sit and talk to each and every one of them to listen to their problems and how she can help. She’s just busy solving every problem she can come up with in the meantime. It’s likely even were the world a perfect utopia, Seleyne would never run out of things to meddle in for the ‘greater good’. That’s just what she does.
