> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We roll for initiative but try and talk to the suspect.  He claims to be on a mission from [[Iydahtl Whitewing]] himself.  He says he is looking for a female elf with a silver wyrmling dragon.  This elf is known by the name of Brinn.  He says we can bring her to [[Hkosyl]].  This silver dragon is one of the last known descendants of the  Cebraas.  There is a creature that is trying to influence people even in his own organization.  Known as Xyz.

>We kill the gnome and he changes back to a doppleganger.  [[Dekk]] rewards us with an unknown wand for Giorgio.  Thus completing [[Find Killer]].  We continue on to [[Kaia's Lodge]].  We come across some heavily furred people on the road.  They are bandits who recently robbed a larger woman on the road.  Found out that bugbears used to rule Neceasey group of humans.  We continued until we arrived at [[Kaia's Lodge]].   It is immediately a tense atmosphere.  Present is a Half-Elf with brown hair.  Also a dragonborn wearing a white robe with jagged red lines.  

>[[Kaia]] said the lady was fine but her husband died of a heart attack.  She traded coat and necklace to get to the Lodge.  [[Kaia]] was wondering if we could take the big lady to [[Enso Vast]].  [[Kaia]] says the lady might want to join the monastery, but taking her to [[Enso Vast]] would be acceptable.

>Farm Folk server said the dragonborn's name was [[Sir Ivethev]].  He is up here looking for [[Brinn Sparkleheart]].  Says she might be  in [[Gavae]].  

>White dragonborn [[Sir Ivethev]] says he is up here looking for [[Brinn Sparkleheart]] as well.  I introduced myself as Mike Rotch

>Big lady introduces herself as Anna....Annabigasslady
