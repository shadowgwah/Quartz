> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We try to run but the Remorhaz catches up to us.  Forces us to fight.  We luckily defeat him and continue.  We continue to our destination and enter a room where we are attacked by a demon.  We meet Sileena Silverlake, Sahkayanna Anniscursed, and Nolyako of Iccarox, and sparkly pale Lady Katalaya Diamondwing[[Lady Diamondwing]].

>[[Lady Diamondwing]] says that not too far from [[Kyonssae]] there are couple of grimlocks that are following a couple of outsiders.  A strange man entirely hairless, sickly gray skin seems to be with them.  The eyeless things seem to enter thru the front, but the gray man seemed to walk thru the stone.  She has a possible name Maeder.  The lair is straight east from [[Kynossae]].  There is a statue of a dire wolf that sits in the forest and the entrance is right a round the corner from it.  Navaidi was a part of the diamondwing gang.  But was kicked out and found her way to the grimlocks.  She was tracked down and was killed but her final words were towards this Xyz saying she has done as they asked.  Navaidi was located on the blindwater river  at a bend in it.

> We see a vision of [[Brinn Sparkleheart]] going thru a cramped tunnel with armored dwarves.  Including one wearing a backpack with tubes.  She is apparently with the Thavarr dwarves.  The dwarves are trying to reclaim their home from the White Dragon.  We are unaware of why they would want her.

> We got transported back to [[Enso Vast]].  This time we went to the dwarf bar.  We talked to Skaddak who told us a little about the Thavarr dwarves.  How they used to be ruled by Grussulir Shadowbraids.  Had a unique ability to find gems.  They were destroyed by the white dragon Sealdusin.  About 287 years ago.  He also said that [[Lady Diamondwing]] has summoned all the Remorhaz.
