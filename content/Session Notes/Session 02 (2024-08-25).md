> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>[[Okuluuna]] suggested to [[Tashi Thistlebottom]] that she should talk to [[Vedbeoth]].  While she was walking to talk to them we noticed winter wolves and a bunch of Grimlocks coming down the hill to attack.  After fight we found out about two weeks ago white wyrmling dragon had his eye removed.  It fits with the eye [[Vedbeoth]] has.  We went to ask [[Vedbeoth]] questions.  Kicked open his door and were attacked by him and two ice mephits.
>Retrieves a letter after a stoppage and gives it to us to read:

>Vedbeoth,
>
>Stay patient, stay vigilant.  I will have further orders for you soon, and reinforcements.  The eye is but the first of many gifts.  I see all, and know your loyalty.  Vision knows not to cross you or I, and will keep the Eyeless ones in line.  Watch [[Dakhsun Vede]].  He is the only one with the power to interfere.
>
>-Xyz

>Asked [[Vedbeoth]] these questions:
>
>"Why do they take bodies across the river?" - the last two the dwarfs brought it on their selves. they tried to cheat.  They brought me this armor it is not what they promised.  The town has long kept a deal, we have survived in these snow for far far longer.  They are only here for him.  You can sneer at me all you want but we have a deal.  In exchange we all live another cycle.
>
>"Who or what is Vision?" - that name was chosen by the eyeless ones.
>
>"Who is Xyz?" - Has many eyes.  Full control over the ice and snow.

>Asked [[Dakhsun Vede]] about Xyz/Vision - Doesn't know Vision.  He wishes to send us to hear from [[Lady Diamondwing]] [[Visit the Lady Diamondwing]].  We accept the quest.  In return we could keep the horses.

>Says [[Keevee]] - Kobold Herbalist has healing potions at [[Keevee Herbalism]]

>[[Graaq]] the Blacksmith - Blacksmith who owns [[Graaq's Blacksmithing]]

>[[Iydahtl Whitewing]]: Half-white Dragon mage, a close advisor of Cebraas. Considered by many a better ruler than young, untested Ravveiarye, Iydahtl declared himself Emperor just before game start and has declared martial law.  He is half dragon half dragonborn no fire or cold can touch him.
