> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>Starting in [[Kynossae]] in [[Cerebach]].  [[Kynossae]] controls the main crossing of the Blindwater.  Therefore it gets under attack often.

>[[Tashi Thistlebottom]]- bard

>Wolves attacked our caravan, killing a kids mom and dad.  Tashi heals the kid([[Nyergen]] - male).  His family was bringing a diamond to [[Kynossae]] and to give it to the head of the militia [[Dakhsun Vede]]  Dakhsun is the leader of the [[Knights of the Rose Dragon]].  Seems weird that someone as renowned as him would be out here in a no name position.  [[Nyergen]] tells us his aunt [[Okuluuna]] runs the [[Nalivka Hole Inn]] in [[Kynossae]].

>Came upon a shrine with two people currently praying at it. yellowish creature with wings swirled in bits of rock(Dust Mephit).  The statues of people appear to be petrified dwarfs.  We were then ambushed again by Grimlocks

>During the battle [[Dakhsun Vede]] "came" to our rescue.  News from the capital is Ceberas(the silver dragon) is dead.  We have lost people to the "Vision"  The [[Lady Diamondwing]] has been asked by Dakhsun for help

>We rode off to [[Nalivka Hole Inn]] with the statues in tow, following Dakhsun. 
[[Nalivka Hole Inn]] (fishing hole inn)
[[Okuluuna]] - woman in charge of the establishment
[[Dakhsun Vede]] has promised us a revive if one of us falls
