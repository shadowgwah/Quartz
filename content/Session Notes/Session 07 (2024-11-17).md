> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>[[Dakhsun Vede]] wants us to check out the Grimlock Hills to follow up on the info provided by [[Lady Diamondwing]].   We come across a cabin with a frozen body in the bed.  The body is wearing a full suit of armor.  The markings resemble the mercenary company of the grinning skull.  They claim to follow "the Vagabond" some sort of a leader.
>4'10" short lady Equagga sent by [[Lady Diamondwing]].  She says Maeder is Visions new husband.  Visions is the leader of the grimlocks.  Visions is an archer who poisons her arrow tips.
