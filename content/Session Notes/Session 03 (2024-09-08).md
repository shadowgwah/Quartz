> [!quote|no-t] SUMMARY
>We overtake two elderly people on ponies while traveling to [[Coppermute]].  Woman has a wide variety of single edge blades tied upon her back.  She identifies herself as Irene(human).  She says there is a contest today in [[Coppermute]].  Has something to do with skating.  I will see you at [[Dekk]](dwarf) who runs a shop in town.

>Coppermute
>	[[Dekk's Shop]] - [[Dekk]] is mayor of [[Coppermute]]  boots lined in fur, shortsword with face, gemstone, boots with horseshoe.
>	Tavern - North side of town
>	

> [[Neyffa Takkat]](Human) -Dark hair pale skin was pointed out with a scowl.  Had her own shop(general store) but [[Dekk]] ran her out of business.  
> 				[[Lhytris Takkat]] Male human - Dark hair pale skin but male
> 				[[Iandro One-Ear]] - Had a scar down his chin and missing an ear.  ring through bottom of lip.  Lost his ear to cannibal bastards to the  North. 
> 					Would like us  break into Dekk's to make a mess
> 				3x same looking guys identified by sash color.
> Past a stranger who was sniffing the air, and he apparently murdered the kid at Dekk's shop. I took the money disguised as [[Iandro One-Ear]], then left to go preach at the inn with a cup out.  the kid was collecting skins off of goats and stuff.  Wanted to make a giant drum cuz it is cool.  Bladed weapon or pointed end slashed the kid's throat.  Was a small blade potential curved stabbed in and out.  Dekk asked our group to find out who murdered the kid at the shop [[Find Killer]] .  I got him to throw in some boots of winterland and Thunk got the hell hound cloak.  I remembered a generic guy possible but sniffed the air, loved cheese, and licked his lips a lot.  While we search for the possible murder we find a cart on the way and they said a gnome bought cheese and pointed us back to [[Kynossae]].  We traveled back there and saw our mark sitting at a table.  Roll for initiative.....
